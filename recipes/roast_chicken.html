	<h3> Roast Chicken with Orange, Cumin & Apricot Rice </h3>
	<p> 
		This is a classic one-pot dish that I often make at home. <br>
		Every part of the meal is comforting and delicious, but <br>
		the truly heavenly bit is the crispy, anchovy-flavoured chicken skin.

	<p>
		<b>Serves 6</b><br>
		2 large garlic cloves, peeled <br>
		2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for frying<br>
		6 salted anchovies in extra-virgin olive oil<br>
		1 large free-range chicken (1.8 kg/3 lbs 15 oz)<br>
		Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
		2 banana shallots (eschalions), sliced finely <br>
		1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds<br>
		1/2 tablespoons sweet smoked pimenton de la Vera<br>
		1 tablespoon hot smoked pimenton de la Vera<br>
		500 g (1 lb 2 1/4 oz) Calasparra rice or another short-grain rice, soaked for 1- minutes in cold water and drained<br>
		zest and juice of 1/2 orange<br>
		100 g(3 1/2 oz | 1/2 cup) dried apricots, chopped<br>
		1 bay leaf<br>
		1 sprig of rosemary<br>
		1 liter (34 fl oz | 4 cups) chicken stock<br>
		small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Instructions</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Preheat the oven to 200<sup>o</sup>C (400<sup>o</sup>F / Gas 6).<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In a small food processor or using a heavy pestle and mortar, <br>
		blend the garlic cloves with the olive oil and half of the anchovies<br>
		to a rough paste.
	</p>
	<p>
		Carefully loosen the skin from the breasts of the chicken<br>
		and rub the garlic and anchovy mixture underneath the skin.<br>
		Season well with salt. Place the chicken in a deep, lidded casserole dish (Dutch Oven)<br>
		and roast, uncovered, for 35 minutes, until the skin is golden.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, add a little oil to a saucepan and fry the shallots<br>
		with the rest of the anchovies and a pinch of salt over a medium heat for 5 minutes,<br>
		or until softened. Add the cumin seeds and both types of pimenton and fry for 1-2 miunutes,<br>
		until fragrant. Mix in the rice, orange zest and juice and dried apricots. <br>
		Add the bay leaf, rosemary and chicken stock, bring to a boil, <br>
		then remove from the heat and set aside. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Remove the casserole dish from the oven, carefully lift out the chicken <br>
		and place on a chopping block. Add the rice and stock mixture to the dish and place<br>
		the chicken back on top. Reduce the oven to 180<sup>o</sup>C(350<sup>o</sup>F | Gas 4)<br>
		and roast, covered, for 1 hour. At this point, check to see if the rice is cooked.<br>
		If needed, add a little more stock and cook for a further 10 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Remove the casserole dish from the oven and lift the chicken back<br>
		onto the chopping block, tipping it over the dish first so that any juices run back<br>
		into the rice. Leave the chicken to rest for 5-10 minutes, loosely covered with foil.<br>
		Taste the rice, season and stir through the parsley. Place the lid back on the dish<br>
		to keep warm as you carve the chicken.<br>
		Dish up onto warm plates with the rice and enjoy :D
