		<h3>
			Cheese-Stuffed Fried Olives
		</h3>
		<i>Olives trees are inextricably linked to Mediterranean culture,<br>
			with olive oil being one of the main ingredients in our cuisine.<br>
			In fact, although there are 300 million olive trees in Spain, <br>
			only 5% of those are eaten; the rest are used for making olive oil.<br>
			When you think of all the olives eaten, it makes sense - yes, they are very common, <br>
			but they should be given more credit as a high-quality product. <br>
			Gordales are one of my favourite varieties; <b>gorda</b> means 'fat' and, indeed, <br>
			these olives are plump and almost meaty.

	<p>
		Stuff the olives with as much manchego as you can fit<br>
		inside them. Place the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs in three separate shallow bowls.<br>
		Roll the olives in the flour, then in the beaten egg, and finally in the breadcrumbs.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Heat 2 cm(3/4in) of oil in a deep saucepan to 180<sup>o</sup>C (350<sup>o</sup>F)<br>
		- or until a cube of bread browns in about 20 seconds. <br>
		Lower the olives into the oil and fry for a few minutes until golden brown.<br>
		Drain on some paper towel, season to taste with sea salt and serve with a cold glass of sherry.
